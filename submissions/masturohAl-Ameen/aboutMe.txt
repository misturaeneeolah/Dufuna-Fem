Hello World!
I am Masturoh Al-Ameen.
I am excited to be here!
I love coding and would do my best to be the best I can be.
At the end of this program, I hope to have achieved a great feat. I hope I would be among the most skilled or best students to make Dufuna-fem proud.
I also hope the program will enhance my knowledge and skills in other programming languages, especially python.
I hope to get a good job and use the skills acquired to better people's lives and create solutions.
Thank you Dufuna for this great opportunity.
